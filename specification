Revision 0.1

Character should be stored in a CouchDB database.  Each character sheet stored
as a document in that database:

Additional data that will be stored in the database are templates.  Templates
are basically the 'default' stats that are shown on a sheet of that type, even
when they're zeroes.  It's literally just a blank slate shown on the sheet,
prompting the player with options in Character Generation and beyond.

Clearly the intent of this data structure is to do some fancy-pants map-reduce
when we query into it.

A script, probably written with Javascript (Node) but I'm open to Python, will
be called into by RhostMUSH execscript to implement all sheet interactions:

+sheet
+sheet me
+sheet <name>
	Show my/someone else's character sheet

+sheet/<section>
+sheet/<section> me
+sheet/<section> <name>
	Show my/someone else's character sheet, but just one section

+sheet/show here
+sheet/show name
	Show someone else my sheet/the room I'm in

+sheet/show/<section> here
+sheet/show/<section> name
	Show someone else my sheet/the room I'm in, but just one section

+sheet/prove stat/value=name
+sheet/prove stat/value=here
	Prove to someone that I have a stat of at least that value

+roll
	This is going to have all the usual things. I'll spec it later as needed
